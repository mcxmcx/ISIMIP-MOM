Projections for ISIMIP-MOM manuscript

In this file it includes the future projections of water temperature, DO concentration, SRP concentration and P.rubs biomass for Rappbode Reservoir, under 3 RCP scenarios (bottom withdrawal strategy), and also RCP8.5 (surface withdrawal strategy). Here the model used is CE-QUAL-W2. For your convenience, I also uploaded the R code for the post-processing and ploting.
